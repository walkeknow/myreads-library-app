# MyReads

A book tracking app built with React.js

## Features
- allows users to search for books based on title or author
- users can add books to their library
- library bookshelves are categorized as  'Currently Reading', 'Want to Read', and 'Read'
- users can move books between bookshelves, or remove them from their library

## Installation and Usage
- install all project dependencies with `npm install`
- start the development server with `npm start`

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
